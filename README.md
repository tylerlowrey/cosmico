A basic game engine written in rust using wgpu. This is just an engine for me to mess around in and learn more about graphics programming and game development

A big thanks to the [Learn Wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu) series for providing the knowledge foundation and code snippets for creating this hobby engine. [Link to the Learn Wgpu code license](https://github.com/sotrh/learn-wgpu/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
